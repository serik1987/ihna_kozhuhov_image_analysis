1. OVERVIEW

In 2003 Dr. Valery Kalatsky suggested a novel paradigm for brain investigation by the method of
intrinsic-signal optical imaging technique. The essence of this technique is the following.
The primary visual cortex is stimulated by a drifting grating which orientation changes continuously
and periodically with a period equal to 1 minute. This means that the neural activity from a
partucular column will also make oscillations with this particular period. So does the intrinsic
signal. Hence, if we record the intrinsic signal and extract 1min-oscillations from it we will deal
with only that part of the signal that includes the response to the stimulus. The other more
powerful components of the intrinsic signal, especially those connected with breath rate and heart rate
will be excluded from an analysis.

For more detailed description of this method see the following paper:
Kalatsky V.A., Stryker P.S. New Paradigm for Optical Imaging: Temporally Encoded Maps of Intrinsic Signal.
Neuron. 2003. V. 38. N. 4. P. 529-545
This is your responsibility to cite this paper when you have done the research and used this package
for this purpose.

Dr. Valery Kalatsky supplied a program (called 'iman') that processes the data generated under continuous
stimulation paradigm. This program was extremely useful for making a scientific progress over 17 years.
However, at this moment important disadvantages in this program were found and this is clear that the
program shall be reconstructed.

In 2020 Dr. Sergei A. Kozhukhov reconstructed the IMAN and represented it in a way of C++
written Python module. The reconstructed version of the program have the following advantages comparing with
the original IMAN:

    (a) The program has been built under Linux v. 5.3 operating system while the original version of the
        program was built under older versions of Linux and failed to run in newer Linux'es.

    (b) A convenient feature of the program is existence of this its build for 64-bit Windows operating
        system.

    (c) When we treat about the IMAN program this was possible to make its builds under newer versions of
        any POSIX-compliant operating system (including Linux and Mac OS X) but such builds are not able
        to read the data recorded under the original data acquisition program developed by V. Kalatsky.
        This is not truth for the ihna.kozhukhov.imageanalysis package. This package may be build under any
        type of POSIX-compliant and Windows operating system and such build will read the original
        experiment records.

    (d) A convenient GUI interface is provided by the program. However, possibility to run the processing
        modules from the Python or iPython command line also exist. If you want to use this package from the
        Jupyter notebook, just do it.

    (e) While IMAN allowed to provide trace analysis for up to four pixels, the ihna.kozhukhov.imageanalysis
        provides trace analysis for a certain set of pixels define by the map ROI.

    (f) ihna.kozhukhov.imageanalysis provides an interactive tool to define a rectangular ROI and create
        complex ROI containing several simple rectangular ROIs. The program averages all traces recorded from
        all pixels belonging to the ROI.

    (g) The original IMAN saves traces as temporal dependencies of the signal on the frame number. It doesn't
        use frame arrival times. The ihna.kozhukhov.imageanalysis creates a temporal axis based on frame
        arrival times and such axis will be saved together with intinsic signal values at certain times.

However, the updated program has lost some of features that were treated to be deprecated. Especially,

    (a) The program doesn't work with episodic stimulation since such stimulation protocol has not been used
        for over 10 years.

    (b) The program doesn't open the data in so called 'old format', that is, the data recorded before 2003.

    (c) Green map analysis is also inavailable from the new version


1.2 WAYS TO USE THIS APPLICATION

USE IT AS AN ORDINARY USER if you want to get a convenient graphical user interface that allows you to interactively
manipulate with your experimental data. The GUI contains only limited functionality that will allow to to complete
current project successfully. However application of this package to any other tools will require either new
experimental data or USING IT AS AN EXPERT.

USE IT AS AN EXPERT if you have a good knowledge of Python, NUMPY, Matplotlib, iPython, the Jupyter Notebook,
Scipy and Pandas. We also advice you to additionally install Anaconda - a Matlab-like interface that allows you to
work on Python-written code. After you studied the usage of this program as an expert, you can find new ways of
using this program, establish its interactions with another packages developed in another laboratories (BluePyOpt is
among them) and thus achieve more advances in science. The expert usage of this package will free you from studying
Matlab, R and/or SPSS, Just learn the packages mentioned above and of course this Documentation and Use it as an expert.

USE IT AS A GOD if are have strong background in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science and you know C++ very well.
When using as a god you don't need Python to be pre-installed. Anything what you need is to find C++ classes in the
cpp folder. Include all .cpp files within this folder to your project and use cpp as an include directory. Create your
own C++ application based on the classes provided. All necessary information can be found in docstrings to these
classes (In JetBrain CLion press Ctrl-Q for opening the documentation).


1.3. GENERAL CONCEPTS

A 32-BIT OPERATING SYSTEM
A type of operating system that uses 32 bits (4 bytes) to store memory addresses. This requires less
operating memory than the 64-bit operating system but it doesn't support the operating memory higher than 4 GB.
Both Windows and Linux can be 32-bit
Right-click on 'My Computer' and select 'Properties' to check whether your operating system is 32-bit.

A 64-BIT OPERATING SYSTEM
A type of operating system that uses 64 bits (8 bytes) to store memory adresses. This type supports operating memories
higher than 4 GB but requires more operating memory to be installed.Both Windows and Linux can be 64-bit.
Right-click on 'My Computer' and select 'Properties' to check whether your operating system is 64-bit.

AMPLITUDE MAP
A map that tells you how the population located at a particular point on the map is selective to the presented visual
stimulus

AVERAGED MAP

recorded is responsible for a certain stimulus. The AMPLITUDE MAP and the PHASE MAP are particular cases of the
AVERAGED MAPS

A BUILD
A version of this package that can be used only for a certain platform. For example, builds for 64-bit Windows
can be launched under 64-bit Windows only and will failed to be run under Linux or 32-bit Windows. Also, you can't run
build for 64-bit Linux on 32-bit Linux and any type of Windows. Mac OS X operating system will run only builds for
Mac OS X.
Use a build suitable for your platform. If you don't have such a build, download the SOURCES and BUILD them to generate
a new build suitable for you.

TO BUILD
To geenerate a new build for a platform you are currently working on from the SOURCES. The building process requires
the COMPILER to be preinstalled.

COMPILER
A special application that builds the package from its sources. If no compiler is installed you can still use one of
existent builds of the program but you can't create your own builds. Since the compiler has been installed successfully,
you are not requires to run this. Just run the setup.py script that in turn will run an appropriate compiler.
If you are working under Windows you need to install and to use Microsoft Visual Studio. However, if you are working
under Linux or Mac OS X you need to install and use g++.

COMPLEX MAP
A 2D matrix containing complex number which modulus will give an amplitude maps and which argument will give the
phase map.

COMPLEX ROI
A ROI that can be consists of several simple or comples ROIs and contains all pixels that are contained by at least one
of these ROIs.

TO COMPRESS
To transform the data into their compressed state.

COMPRESSED STATE
State of the data when they contain all information recorded during the experiment occupying little volume on the
hard drive. You can't process the data stored in the compressed state and you need to DECOMPRESS it first.

TO DECOMPRESS
To transform the data into their decompressed state.

DECOMPRESSED STATE
State of the data when they they are ready for any kind of processing (including frame view, trace analysis and
building averaged amplitude and phase maps). The data in the decompressed state stores too long volume and you
probably need to

ELECTRONIC LAB JOURNAL
A special space where you can make notes about stimulation pecularities, animal state, substances induced etc.

FILE TRAIN
A sequence of files that can store a single record. During the experiment the whole record is splitted into several
parts and each of the part is stored in a separate file. All files within the train are required for the data to be
opened. All of them shall exist in a stand alone folder and their names shall be the same as given at the record.

A FRAME
An image of the cortex made during a particular time. The FILE TRAIN contains temporal sequence of the frames recorded
an consequtive times.

G++
A C++ compiler working on Linux. This is the only compiler you can use to create a build for Linux or Mac OS X.

GUI SHELL

A combination of the operating system and a Python 3 interpreter run under this particular operating system.

PHASE MAP
A map that tells you a feature that a particular neural population is tuned for depending on its location.

PYTHON
A programming language that is very useful for writing a scientific software.

PYTHON 3
The newest version of the Python programming language. This version has not forward and backward compatibility with
the odler version called Python 2, so, all packages written in Python 2 will not run under Python 3 and vice versa.

PYTHON INTERPRETER
A special program that is required to run the software written in the Python programming language. You can't use
this package without Python interpreter, however, since the interpreter is installed successfully, you are not
required to run this alone. Just click on the GUI application, this will start the Python interpeter and loads
the package into it.

PYTHON 3 INTERPRETER
A special program that is required to the software written in the Python 3 programming language. Especially,
this package is required Python to be installed on your PC.

REGION OF INTEREST (ROI)
A part of the maps which data you will use for the following analysis and calculating statistics. Because the instinsic
signal is spatially noisy, you can't read the signal recorded from a particular point directly but you shall select
an arbitrary piece of the maps and average the data across all pixels belonging to this piece.

SIMPLE ROI
A ROI that has a rectangular form.

SOURCE FILES
A version of this package that can be used to generate a particular build for a platform you are currently working on.
If you have source files, you can't run and use them directly, you need first, to make a particular build and then
to use a build you are currently made.

SYNCHRONIZATION
Establishing the relationship between a frame and a particular stimulus value. The synchronization process includes:
    (1) Reading the signal from the synchronization channel
    (2) Defining the analysis initial and final frame
    (3) Construction of the reference signal scalar-prodict of the frame sequence to the reference signal will get

WORKING FOLDER
The folder containing all the data related to a particular project.


3. INSTALLATION

3.1. INSTALLATION WAYS

This tool has been written both on Python and on C++. This means that it contains a platform-independent code that
shall be loaded into the Python interpreter and executed by means of the Python interpreter and a platform-independent
code that can't be executed directly and shall be transformed into CPU instructions by the process called 'building'.
This means that the first process of using this tool is to build this for your platform.

The building if the process of generation of new build of this tool. Another way to use it is to download some build
for your platform that has already been made. We consider both ways.

3.2. BUILDING THE PACKAGE FROM SOURCES

3.2.1 DOWNLOADING THE SOURCES

The package can be downloaded from the following link:

https://github.com/serik1987/ihna_kozhuhov_image_analysis

Press the button "Clone or download" and then choose the option "Download ZIP". You will download an archive that
contains a single folder. Unpack this folder to any destination folder. This folder is called 'installation folder'.
You can put the installation folder on your desktop or in the Downloads folder. This doesn't matter because you don't
need in this folder and its content after successfull build and installation and you will simply delete this. In any
way this tool shall be placed and will be placed to the same drive as you installed Python.

The next building process will occur in the command line. In Linux, right-click on the installation folder and choose
'Open in Terminal'. In Windows the process is more complicated:

    (1) Open the Windows menu and in the Search string type 'cmd'. You will see an icon corresponding to the CMD
        application
    (2) Right-click on the icon and choose "Run as a system administrator"
    (3) You will see the black window where you shall install the program.
    (4) In this window type 'cd' (withot quotes) and press space. Drag you installation folder to the CMD window and
        press Enter.

3.2.2. CHECKING FOR PYTHON

The following step is to ensure that the Python is installed correctly. Python is an interpreter that is responsible for
interaction between this tool and the operating system. Without Python you can't use this tool. To check the Python
installation version type the following command:

python --version

If you see that the command is not found. One of the following problems happened:

    (a) You did not install Python 3. Please, download and install this! In Linux Ubuntu, you shall simply run the
        following string:

sudo apt install python3

        For Windows a simple graphical interface is provided. Just use Google or Yandex to find Python 3, download and
        run it.

    (b) You have installed Python 3 but the Windows doesn't see this. Read the following instructions on how to fix
        this problem:

https://docs.python.org/3.8/using/windows.html#configuring-python

If this command is executed successfully but has written something like:
Python 2.7.17

This means that your operating system uses the old version of the Python and you need to tell it to use new version.
In Linux you can use it by running the following command:

sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/pip3 /usr/bin/pip

In Windows you shall check the following instructions on how to fix this problem:

https://docs.python.org/3.8/using/windows.html#configuring-python

If you see the following line:
Python 3.6.9
(two last numbers doesn't matter, the only important thing is they shall be preceeded by the number '3' that tells you
that you are currently using Python 3, not Python 2)

you can continue the building process.

3.2.3. CHECKING FOR THE COMPILER

The compiler is a special program that transforms platform-independent sources that are unable to use into platform
dependent build that may be used under the specific build. The compiler is needed for you during the installation
process. After you installed the program successfully, you can removes your compiler if you don't use it (for instance,
if you don't write program on C/C++). Compiler is needed to build and install this package but it doesn't need to run
it.

In Linux you shall use g++. Install it by the following command:

sudo apt install g++

In Windows you shall download and install Microsoft Visual Studio. This package will not be build on another Windows
compilers (such as Borland C++ Builder).

3.2.4. CREATING THE BUILD OF THE PROGRAM

Run the following command to create the build:

python setup.py build

This program will generate new build for your platform and put it into the 'build' folder.

3.2.5. INSTALLING THE PROGRAM

Type the following instruction to do this:

python setup.py install

In Linux you shall use another command:

sudo python setup.py install

3.2.6. TROUBLE SOLUTION

    (a) The installer says 'please, use the python3'
        In all commands above you shall replace 'python' by 'python3 and 'pip' by 'pip3'. An alternative way in Linux
        is to use the following command to fix:

sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/pip3 /usr/bin/pip

        In Windows, you shall change the environmental variables or (if you don't know how to do this) remove all
        versions of Python and install the latest one given that this is Python 3.

    (b) The installer says that 'Permission denied' or 'Отказано в доступе':
        You try to perform operation in non-priviledged mode. The solution is to enter to the priviledged mode. If you
        are working under windows, close the CMD, read section 3.2.1 carefully and do it again. Note, that you shall
        run CMD as a System administrator (or: "Запустить от имени системного администратора"), otherwise the
        installation will not work.
        If you are working under Linux, put 'sudo' before the command you are currently trying to run. Don't forget to
        put space to separate your command from the 'sudo' word.

    (c) If the installer writes you that the NUMPY package has not been found or the compiler if failed to find
        numpy/ndarray.h, the problem is the same: you don't install the additional Python package. The following
        command will fix this problem:

pip install numpy

3.3. INSTALLATION THE PACKAGE THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN BUILD BY YOUR COLLEAGUE

If your colleague is successful in building this package and you have the same platform as him (i.e., the same
version of Python and the same operating system) You can download the installation folder from him.
In this case you shall follow the steps 3.2.1-3.2.2, 3.2.4-3.2.5 and skip the step 3.2.3. In the step 3.2.5, when you
write:

python setup.py build

the installation script will check whether the provided build is suitable for your platform. Such check doesn't require
the compiler to be installed on your PC. If this check is OK this command will be completed successful. However
if the existent build is not suitable for your PC, this command will try to create a new build and this process will
of course requires the compiler to be installed.
